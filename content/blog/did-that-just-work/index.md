I think (and this post being online should prove it) that the blog has just moved to its new, permanent, home within the Junior House github organization. Yay! (Yay?) If this is the case, we should expect either of Alex or Harry to come in hot with some unintelligible nonsense sometime soon. Does this blog have spell check?
