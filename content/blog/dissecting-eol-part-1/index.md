**Chapter One: What to ask?**

How do you build a digital sharing environment?
How do you install a pervasive willingness to communicate into each and every user?
How do you promote personal interaction in the most impersonal environment? 

I'm trying something new here -- rationalizing out loud. I often find the mass-internalization of thoughts to be wildly counter-productive. It's time for a different approach; to think as I write. The target of this study: a complex idea that I'd like to understand. 

It's called EOL, or the Encyclopedia of Life. Let me throw a quick, rudimentary idea pitch your way: the EOL platform will be an experience-sharing platform where people can engage in beautiful dialogue around others' geographically-positioned experiences and learn about the next unique activity to undertake. At the inception of this idea during freshman year, my understanding was dominated by that of a two-sided market -- one where creators would explicitly create content (share experiences on a map) and consumers would explicitly consume the content (learn about the experiences of others). Yet, in the past week, as the idea of EOL was reawakened after a two-year hibernation period, I discovered a gaping flaw in this design. 

It's complex. No... that's not exactly true. It's a relatively simple design -- just not simple enough. Let me explain. Two-sided platforms, meaning platforms that cater towards two opposing audiences (i.e. multiple inter-dependent, cornerstone user groups), such as the creator and the consumer, are inherently fragile. If your product doesn't attract audience A, you're SOL. If the B user doesn't migrate over, you may as well surrender your every effort. Introducing this sort of user-defined complexity introduces tenfold potential points for failure.  

The better, far more simple design unifies the creator and the consumer. It incentivizes the creator to consume and the consumer to create. By providing a single simple role to each user, we are drastically ameliorating the general platform experience. To further grow this argument, allow me to introduce two case studies: exhibit A, the standard to which EOL must assimilate itself, and exhibit B, the standard from which EOL must distance itself. 

We'll let Reddit assume the role of exhibit A for the following single, all-encompassing reason. There is absolutely no delineation on the Reddit platform between who shares content and who absorbs content. Those who take from the platform also give and, as you may have guessed, those who give will also take. While this isn't a strict rule (as an counter-example, a "lurker" is an active user who rarely contributes), the pattern is nonetheless cemented into the fabric of Reddit -- the ongoing dialogue in every subreddit and every thread involves every visitor (and, for the most part, every purposeful visitor engages in the dialogue).

However, distancing is often harder than adhering -- let's look at our exhibit B, Yelp. Yelp's business review platform does a beautiful job divvying up platform roles between the creator and the consumer (otherwise known as the reviewer and the costumer). As outlined previously, this produces a sort of market inefficiency hinged upon inter-network effects -- customers will avoid a platform sans reviews, and reviewers will avoid a platform sans the customers to grant recognition. 

Yet, the consequential fragility that this architecture imposes isn't the problem that I'd like to highlight. Rather, I want to build a conversation around the notion of community -- how does Reddit provide a gold standard for sharing and active dialogue? What internal mechanism differentiates Reddit from Yelp and its strict business-driven division of roles (reviewers review and customers read)? 

The goal behind dissecting this problem is to intelligently overlay the results onto the development of EOL. Ideally, this approach will bring rise to a product that ports the cooperative and communicative sentiment of Reddit to the fresh realm of experience sharing. Where instead of dividing conversation thematically between subreddits, users can engage in conversation defined by location-based shared experiences. To chat. And to learn. People take tremendous pride in the experiences they love. EOL will provide them the opportunity to grow their experiential pride in collaboration with the millions of others that they share it with.

Worry not -- these questions and this vision will not stay unsolved for long. I may give it a crack tomorrow if the schedule permits. I'm tired. Goodnight.
