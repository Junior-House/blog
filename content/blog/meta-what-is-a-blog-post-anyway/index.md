> “First, your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement so I _must_ do nothing. And secondly, you must be a _pirate_ for the pirate's code to apply and you're _not_. And thirdly, the code is more what you'd call "guidelines" than actual _rules_. Welcome aboard the _Black Pearl_, Miss Turner!” - **Captain Barbossa**

It comes to my attention that, as it stands, we are tightrope walking without a net. That is to say, we appear to be already playing a game with undefined rules: we have been writing blog posts without knowing precisely what a blog post is. No game is fun without rules; hence, is now necessary to rigorously define the *concept* of a Junior House blog post before continuing, lest the sentence “Junior House is a blog” fail to obtain any meaning whatsoever.

## So what is a blog post, actually?

Speaking technically, a blog post (in the context of *this* blog) is anything that can be displayed in markdown file format. This definition will not do. It leaves us with an uncountably infinite number of possible posts, the set of which becomes difficult to wrangle with conventional logic.

When a set of possibilities becomes so large as to be disorienting, we overcome our paralysis with rules — err, *guidelines*. Here be the guidelines:

## The Junior House Pirate Code

**1. Junior House blog posts are fundamentally uncorroborated insights into the world.**

I say “uncorroborated” only to not say “unedited.” Blog posts can certainly be edited, by their author, as clarity in the dissemination of ideas is imperative. Yet we mandate uncorroborated insights, admitting myopia, to preserve the integrity of individuality. I would rather be *wrong* than sign my name under groupthink.

Of course, many of history’s most compelling ideas were born out of collaboration, and in some sense there’s nothing new under the sun, anyway. For this reason Junior House blog posts are only *fundamentally* uncorroborated. They take risks. These risks have jumping-off points that are well-founded. Anything more or anything less is in my view unphilosophical.

***

**2. Junior House blog posts take entropy at face value.**

Reality can be a nihilistic experience, and this realization can have chaotic implications. To wade too deep in these implications can be hazardous to one’s convictions. Yet at the depths, much great science and literature gets done.

I expect this blog to contribute nothing to either science or literature. It might even anti-contribute, by leaving red herrings for future historians, alien species, or sentient rats. Nonetheless, I think that the triumph over entropy should be a major theme in the content of this blog, as it is (implicitly) in all human endeavors. Buckle up; this train gets existential.

***

**3. Screw rules, man!**

Screw the rules! When was the last time rules did any good for anyone? All they’re really doing is holding us back. *Real* pioneers don’t follow any rules. They blaze their own path. Do we fancy our creative output to be unchained, fresh, and novel? not derivative, regulated, or cowardly? Then screw the rules! So goes the logic behind rule #3.

***

These rules comprise the Code so far. Though, per rule #2, expect convenient amendments to be made with regular frequency. Actually, per rule #3, expect these rules to have no bearing on future blog posts whatsoever. This has been a fun attempt; until next time!
