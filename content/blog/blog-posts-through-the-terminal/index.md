This post should make it official. The latest blog build, with some simple bash scripting, allows us to write posts using a command-line interface and the Xcode editor. Hopefully I hash out some cooler and smarter features soon!

I will have to write up a little bit of setup that Alex and Harry will be able to follow -- the fully automated process involves some environmental variable settings to keep everything consistent. With a bit more development I hope that the process will be totally painless! That should at least make us blog more...
